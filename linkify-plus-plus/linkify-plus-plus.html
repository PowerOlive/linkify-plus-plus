Testcases

There are testcases for Text Link.

Mozilla(http://www.mozilla.org/) started as a project of next generation www-browser of Netscape(http://www.netscape.com/). See http://www.mozilla.org/src-faq.html#1. Mozilla were planned to be released as "Netscape Communicator 5.0", but the new layout engine "NGLayout" ttp://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/gecko.html prevented it. Netscape 6 ttp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/ was released after 2 years from the deciding.And now, the Firefox(h**p://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) web browser is released from the Mozilla Corporation(h++p://www.mozilla.com/).

Now, TextLink can parse splitted text nodes as joined texts. Mozilla(http://www.mozilla.org/) started as a project of next generation www-browser of Netscape(http://www.netscape.com/). See http://www.mozilla.org/src-faq.html#1. Mozilla were planned to be released as "Netscape Communicator 5.0", but the new layout engine "NGLayout" ttp://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/gecko.html prevented it. Netscape 6 ttp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/ was released after 2 years from the deciding.

There are relative links. Firefox www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ is a new type www-browser and it very extendable. You can find many extensions from update.mozilla.org. I also release some extensions. TBE ./tabextensions/index.html.en and PopupALT _popupalt.html.en are parts of them. (Text Link ignores relative pathes which includes only a filename like "_popupalt.html.en", because strings with the pattern usually indicates only filenames, not relative pathes.) See the parent page ../xul/xul.html to find other extensions in this website.

There are links including multi-byte characters. The URI of this website is "ｈｔｔｐ：／／ｐｉｒｏ．ｓａｋｕｒａ．ｎｅ．ｊｐ／", but you can use the secondary URI, "ｔｔｐ：／／ｗｗｗ９８．ｓａｋｕｒａ．ｎｅ．ｊｐ／￣ｐｉｒｏ／" too.
